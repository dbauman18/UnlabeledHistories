# UnlabeledHistories
This is some code to perform computations of balance statistics of unlabeled histories

In a jupyter notebook, I create a Python class enabling computations with unlabeled histories, encoded as integer sequences 
$$(a_1, ..., a_t), \ \text{ with } \ a_1 = 0, \ 1 \leq a_i < i \text{ for } i > 1, |\\{k \ | \ a_k = i\\}| \leq 2 \ \text{for all } i$$
